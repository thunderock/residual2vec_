Potential Problems I can think of:

1. Probably we shouldn't be running crosswalk on train and test set, run it before the split.
2. Tune network, currently only one linear layer after gcnconv layers.
3. Increasing the size of node2vec embedding, currently 16.
4. In negative sampling tune negative samples per node.
5. In every batch we sample a subset of positive and negative adjacency matrix, tune the size of the subset.
6. Visualize crosswalk weights once.
7. test set too big, tune the size of test set. May be it is changing the cluster structure of the graph. And then when we use crosswalk to assign the weights to edges, it is not able to capture the cluster structure of the graph. So, we are not able to predict the test set well.
8. May be node2vec random walks not working for weighted adjacency matrix.

* to be done

* create baseline with crosswalk, fairwalk paired with deepwalk
crosswalk = true => crosswalk
crosswalk = false => fairwalk

node2vec replaced with deepwalk
